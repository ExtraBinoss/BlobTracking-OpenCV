Preprocessing: Cleaning the Image","text":"<p>Before we can find \"blobs\", we need to simplify the video. - Grayscale: Color often distracts the computer. We convert the image to black and white intensities. - Blurring: Real-world video has \"noise\" (grain). We apply a Gaussian Blur to smooth out these imperfections, ensuring we detect large shapes rather than tiny specks of dust.</p>"},{"location":"how-it-works/#2-detection-finding-the-signal","title":"2. Detection: Finding the Signal","text":"<p>This is where the magic happens. We convert the image into a Binary Mask\u2014an image made purely of black (background) and white (foreground) pixels.</p> <ul> <li>Thresholding: A simple cutoff. \"If a pixel is brighter than X, make it white. Otherwise, make it black.\" Great for silhouettes.</li> <li>Canny Edge Detection: Calculates the gradient (rate of change) between pixels to find sharp edges. This creates those \"wireframe\" or \"sketch\" looks.</li> <li>Color Segmentation: Converts the image to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space to isolate specific colors (e.g., \"only show me the red parts\").</li> </ul>"},{"location":"how-it-works/#3-contour-finding","title":"3. Contour Finding","text":"<p>Once we have a binary mask, we use an algorithm (typically Suzuki85) to find the outlines of the white shapes.</p> <p>\"Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points along the boundary which have the same color or intensity.\" \u2014 OpenCV Documentation</p>"},{"location":"how-it-works/#4-centroid-tracking","title":"4. Centroid Tracking","text":"<p>We calculate the \"center of mass\" (centroid) for each shape.

This is often called Acid Graphics or Y2K Futurism. - Fluidity: Blobs behave like liquid (mercury, water, lava). Humans are naturally attracted to fluid motion\u2014it feels biological and alive. - Nostalgia: Reminiscent of early 2000s visuals (Winamp visualizers, iTunes visuals, Windows Media Player) but rendered with modern high-definition crispness.</p>"},{"location":"how-it-works/#generative-art","title":"Generative Art","text":"<p>Unlike a pre-animated video, generative art is unpredictable.
